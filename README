      INI: Ni Interpreter

*********************************
*             About             *
*********************************

This project was created as:
 - a way to learn more about Programming languages, Interpreter implementations
   and generally underlying techniques used in programming, and methods used
   in team development and management
 - a part of project "Implementing imperative language interpreter IFJ13"

*********************************
*             Setup             *
*********************************

If you want to use every feature we provide, these are required:

General:
    git

Compilation:
    GNU make
    gcc

Profiling:
    gprof

Static analysis:
    cppcheck


Our Makefile have more targets:
    (nothing)   - builds release configuration
    debug       - builds debug configuration
    profile     - builds profiling configuration
    clean       - removes all intermediate build files
    analyze     - runs static analysis
    analyzeAll  - runs static analysis also on test files
    test        - runs static analysis and preforms automatic tests
    pack        - packs necessary project files into archive
    callgraph   - after profiling this can be used to generate callgraph
    ctags       - generates ctags
    doc         - generates documentation
    statistics  - prints LOC, size etc.
